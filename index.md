# This is a website for my favourite character Tiffany Aching 

Tiffany Aching is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett’s satirical Discworld series of fantasy novels. 
Her name in Nac Mac Feegle is Tir-far-thóinn or “Land Under Wave”.

Tiffany is a trainee witch whose growth into her job forms one of the many arcs in the Discworld series. 
She is the main character in The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith, I Shall Wear Midnight and 
The Shepherd’s Crown. Tiffany grows up over the course of the series, from nine years old in The Wee Free Men 
to being in her late teens in The Shepherd’s Crown.

“At such times the universe gets a little closer to us. They are strange times, times of beginnings and endings. Dangerous and powerful. And we feel it even if we don't know what it is. These times are not necessarily good, and not necessarily bad. In fact, what they are depends on what *we* are.”
